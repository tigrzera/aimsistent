The Aim Training Browser Game

# 1. Getting Started
**The Intro:** When the site loads, an intro video plays. Once it finishes, you will see the Idle Screen.

**Start:** Click the PLAY button in the center of the screen to trigger the transition into the Main Menu.

# 2. Game Modes
You can choose how you want to train from the Mode Selection screen:

**Dynamic Mode:** Targets move across the screen and bounce off walls. Good for tracking practice.

**Static Mode:** Targets appear in random locations but stay stationary. Good for flicking practice.

**Time Settings:** Click the Standard / Quick Play bar at the bottom to toggle between:

**⏱️ Standard:** 60 Seconds (Purple)

**⚡ Quick Play:** 30 Seconds (Yellow)

# 3. Controls & Gameplay
**Shooting:** Click the Left Mouse Button on a red target to destroy it.

**Keyboard Alternative:** You can enable Z/X Keys in the settings to shoot using your keyboard instead of clicking (similar to osu!).

**Scoring:**

**Score:** Points earned for every hit.

**Combo:** Hitting targets in a row increases your multiplier. Missing a shot resets your combo to 0.

**Accuracy:** Your hit percentage is calculated at the end of the round.

**Pausing:** Press ESC or click the Pause Button (top right) to freeze the game.

# 4. Customization (Settings)
You can access the Settings Menu from the Main Menu, Pause Screen, or Results Screen to tweak the experience:

**Enable Z/X:** Toggles keyboard shooting on or off.

**Target Color:** Use the color picker to change the targets from Red to any color you prefer.

**Hit Sound:** Choose between two sound effects:

**Pop:** A quick bubble sound.

**Knock:** A satisfying wood sound.

# 5. Game Over
When the time runs out (visualized by the blue progress bar at the bottom), the round ends.

A Task Completed card appears showing your Final Score, Max Combo, and Accuracy.

**Confetti:** If you finish a round, a confetti celebration triggers behind the scorecard!
